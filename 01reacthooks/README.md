# React Hooks

React hooks are special functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Before hooks, these features were only available in class components. 

Hooks make it easier to manage state, handle side effects (like data fetching), and share logic between components, all in a simpler and more readable way.

## useState React Hook

The useState hook in React is a special function that lets you add and manage state in a functional component. 

It allows you to store a value (like a variable) and update it when needed, while also making React re-render the component whenever the value changes.
