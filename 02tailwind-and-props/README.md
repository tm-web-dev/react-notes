# What are Components?

Components are reusable building blocks of a React app. They are like JavaScript functions that take input (props) and return JSX to define the UI.

# What are Props?

Props (short for "properties") are like function arguments in React. They are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props are read-only, meaning the child component cannot change them directly.
